# Manhunt

Minecraft java edition 1.16 plugin where a speedrunner tries to beat the game while one or more hunters try to stop him. This plugin is a clone of Dream's plugin.

## Usage

Add this plugin to your server. Set the speedrunner in game by typing this command:
```
/speedrunner player_name
```
to set `player_name` as the speedrunner. The hunters can use `/compass` command (or `/track`) to get a compass to track the speedrunner. The speedrunner can't use the compass however.
